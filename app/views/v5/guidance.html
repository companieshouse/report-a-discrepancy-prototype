    <h3 id="what-a-discrepancy-is" class="govuk-heading-m govuk-!-font-size-27">What a material discrepancy is</h3>
    <p class="govuk-body">This is when the information an obliged entity holds is significantly different to the information recorded by Companies House about a PSC of a company, or a registrable beneficial owner of an overseas entity.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">From 1 April 2023, an amendment to the <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2017/692/contents/made" class="govuk-link">the Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing and Transfer of Funds (Information on the Payer) Regulations 2017</a> came into effect. This means that obliged entities must only report a material discrepancy if it can be reasonably considered to be linked to one or more of the following:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>money laundering </li>
      <li>terrorist financing</li>
      <li>concealing details of the business of the customer</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="govuk-body">Concealing details of the business of the customer includes intentional or unintentional discrepancies. A discrepancy is concealed if information an obliged entity holds does not match information on the Companies House register.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">Money laundering and terrorist financing are defined in <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2017/692/contents/made)" class="govuk-link">regulation 3 of the Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing and Transfer of Funds (Information on the Payer) Regulations 2017</a>. </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">If a discrepancy could not be reasonably considered to be linked to money laundering, terrorist financing or concealing details, you do not need to report it to Companies House. In these cases, you may want to contact the company to advise them to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/companies-house-forms-for-limited-companies#people-with-significant-control-(psc)" class="govuk-link">make a PSC filing</a> to correct the discrepancy.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">If there is a missing entry for a registrable beneficial owner due to the overseas entity not being registered, and you hold information to suggest it should be, you can report this by emailing us at <a class="govuk-link" href="#">roediscrepancies@companieshouse.gov.uk</a>.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">Detailed information about what is expected of obliged entities in relation to the prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing is also available from your supervisory body.   </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">Read <a href="https://www.jmlsg.org.uk/guidance/current-guidance/" class="govuk-link">Part 1 (5.3.129A) of guidance published by JMLSG (Joint Money Laundering Steering Group)</a> for more information. </p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs)</h3>

    <p class="govuk-body">Do not use a discrepancy report in place of a SAR, and do not use a SAR in place of a discrepancy report. In some cases, you may need to submit both a discrepancy report and a SAR. You should not tell us if you have submitted a SAR.</p>

<h3 id="examples-of-material-discrepancies" class="govuk-heading-m govuk-!-font-size-27">Examples of material discrepancies</h3>
    <p class="govuk-body">Material discrepancies that are linked to money laundering, terrorist financing or concealment could include the following examples:</p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">A difference in name</h3>

<p class="govuk-body">An omitted, incomplete, misspelled, or inverted PSC surname or relevant legal entity (RLE) name.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">For example:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>Smith Maria instead of Maria Smith</li>
  <li>Amira Brown instead of Amira Wallace-Brown</li>
  <li>Sunshine News Limited instead of Sunshine News International Limited</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">An incorrect entry for nature of control</h3>

<p class="govuk-body">The PSC’s natures of control do not correctly reflect the control they hold in terms of the qualifying conditions in the <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/993230/170623_NONSTAT_GU__1___3_.pdf" class="govuk-link">BEIS guidance on the register of people with significant control</a>.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">This includes incomplete natures of control, such as missing voting rights.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">For example:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>an individual who holds more than 25% of the shares is notified as a PSC with ‘significant influence or control’</li>
  <li>an individual who holds 50% of the shares is notified as a PSC with ‘ownership of shares – more than 50% but less than 75%’</li>
  <li>an individual who holds more than 25% of the shares and attached voting rights is notified as a PSC with ownership of shares only</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">An incorrect entry for date of birth</h3>
<p class="govuk-body">The PSC’s month or year of birth (or both), as verified by the obliged entity, does not match what is shown on the Companies House register.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">For example, the date of birth on an individual’s passport is 24 May 1985, but the month and year of birth shown in their PSC information on the register is October 1985.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">An incorrect entry for nationality</h3>
<p class="govuk-body">The PSC’s nationality, as verified by obliged entity, does not match the nationality shown on Companies House register.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">For example, an individual has provided an French passport as proof of nationality, however the nationality shown in their PSC information on the register is British.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">An incorrect entry for correspondence address</h3>
<p class="govuk-body">There is an incorrect or missing material element of the address, such as the property number or the postcode.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">For example, the first line of an individual’s correspondence address is ‘4 Daisy Lane’, however the first line of their correspondence address is shown on the Companies House register as ‘Daisy Lane’.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">A missing entry for a PSC or a registrable beneficial owner</h3>
<p class="govuk-body">An individual or legal entity that qualifies as a PSC or RLE has not been notified as a PSC.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">For example, an individual holds more than 25% of the shares, however they have not been notified as a PSC.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">The report must include the reason why they would qualify as a PSC.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">An incorrect entry for the date the individual became a registrable person</h3>
<p class="govuk-body">An individual or legal entity’s notification date is shown as 12 June 2019 on the Companies House register, however their notification date was 27 June 2019.</p>

    <h3 id="what-a-beneficial-owner-is" class="govuk-heading-m govuk-!-font-size-27">What a person with significant control (PSC) is</h3>
    <p class="govuk-body">A <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/people-with-significant-control-pscs" target="_blank" class="govuk-link">person with significant control (PSC)</a> 
      is someone who owns or controls a company. 
      A company can have one or more PSCs, or none. Any reference to companies in this guidance also refers to LLPs and eligible Scottish partnerships.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">A beneficial owner is not the same as a PSC. The requirement to report 
      discrepancies is based on the Companies Act definition of a PSC, rather than the Money 
      Laundering Regulations’ definition of a beneficial owner. This means that the information on the Companies House register 
      might be different to other beneficial ownership information, but it might not be wrong.</p>

    <h3 id="what-a-bo-is" class="govuk-heading-m govuk-!-font-size-27">What a registrable beneficial owner of an overseas entity is</h3>
    <p class="govuk-body">A registrable beneficial owner is any individual or entity that has significant influence or control over an overseas entity. It can be:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>an individual person</li>
      <li>another legal entity, such as a company</li>
      <li>a government or public authority</li>

    <p class="govuk-body">This is any entity required to carry out due diligence checks under anti-money laundering regulations.</p>

      <li>insolvency practitioners</li>

    <h3 id="why-report-a-discrepancy" class="govuk-heading-m govuk-!-font-size-27">Why you need to report a discrepancy</h3>
    <p class="govuk-body"><a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2017/692/regulation/30A" class="govuk-link">Regulation 30A of the Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing and Transfer of Funds (Information on the Payer) Regulations 2017</a> requires obliged entities to report material discrepancies to Companies House. </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">This will help us to make sure that the register is accurate and up to date.</p>

    <h3 id="what-is-not-a-discrepancy" class="govuk-heading-m govuk-!-font-size-27">What you do not need to report</h3>
    <p class="govuk-body">You do not need to report the following:</p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet govuk-list--spaced">
      <li>if a discrepancy is not reasonably considered to be linked to money laundering, terrorist financing or concealing details of the business of the customer, it does not need to be reported to Companies House </li>
      <li>if you’ve already made a discrepancy report, you do not need to report the same discrepancy again</li>
      <li>if the discrepancy is resolved by the company before you submit a report, you do not need to report it</li>
      <li>when an obliged entity holds information that is not required to be included on the Companies House register </li>
      <li>a spelling error - for example, Jon Smith instead of John Smith, or a missing or slightly different spelling of a middle name</li>
      <li>a shortened name - for example, Jim instead of James </li>
      <li>minor variations in an address, or where a nationality of Welsh, English, 
        Scottish or Northern Irish is given, but the register shows UK</li>
      <li>where a company has claimed an exemption from providing their PSC details because they are 
        trading on a regulated market, PSC details will not be shown on the register</li>
      <li>a PSC or beneficial owner of an overseas entity must own more than 25% of shares to be registrable, so you do not need to report them missing if they own 25% or less (this does not affect the duty in terms of PSCs or registrable beneficial owners who control the company in another way)</li>
    </ul>

     <p class="govuk-body">Read the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/people-with-significant-control-pscs#identifying-your-psc" class="govuk-link">People with Significant Control (PSCs) guidance</a> for more information. </p>

    <p class="govuk-body govuk-!-font-weight-bold">If the correspondence address is different from the service address on the Companies House register</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">The address shown for a PSC or a registrable beneficial owner on the Companies House register is a correspondence address, which is also known as a service address. This does not have to be their home address. Obliged entities should take this into consideration.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">PSCs and registrable beneficial owners of an overseas entity must provide their home address to Companies House, but it’s kept on a private register. It’s only available on request to credit reference agencies (unless their details are protected) and specified public authorities.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">As their home address is not available on the public register, it might not 
      be a discrepancy if it does not match the address given to an obliged entity. If the address a 
      customer has provided is different to what is shown on the register, you should consider checking with them if they have used an alternative to their home address as a correspondence address. </p>
    
    <p class="govuk-body">You should only make a report when there is a material discrepancy between the same types of address.</p>


    <h3 id="when-to-make-a-discrepancy-report" class="govuk-heading-m govuk-!-font-size-27">When to make a discrepancy report</h3>

    <p class="govuk-body">The Money Laundering Regulations require obliged entities to report material discrepancies to Companies House which are identified when: </p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>setting up a new business relationship with a customer</li>
      <li>carrying out further due diligence checks throughout the business relationship</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="govuk-body">You should report any material discrepancies as soon as they are identified.</p>

    
    
    <p class="govuk-body">Bulk reporting is not 
      allowed. Obliged entities must not wait to make reports in bulk, as this means the register will not be up to date.</p>

    <h3 id="start" class="govuk-heading-m govuk-!-font-size-27">Make a discrepancy report</h3>

    <p class="govuk-body">From 1 April 2023, you can only use this service to report a material discrepancy if it can be reasonably considered to be linked to one or more of the following:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>money laundering</li>
      <li>terrorist financing</li>
      <li>concealing details of the business of the customer</li>
    </ul>
  
    <p class="govuk-body">This is because of an amendment to the regulations. <a href="../v3/guidance#what-a-discrepancy-is" class="govuk-link">Find out more information about the amendment and what a material discrepancy is</a>. </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">To report a discrepancy, you'll need:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>to tell us what the discrepancy you are reporting relates to - money laundering, terrorist financing or concealment (or a combination of these)</li>
      <li>the company number or Overseas Entity ID of the company or entity being reported as having a discrepancy</li>
      <li>the type of discrepancy</li>
      <li>the information on the  register you believe is incorrect - for example, an incorrect address or an error in the nature of control</li>
      <li>the correct information as you believe it should be shown on the register</li>
      <li>any other relevant information about the discrepancy that supports the report</li>
    </ul>
 
    <p class="govuk-body">If you need to report a discrepancy about multiple PSCs or registrable beneficial owners, you must submit a new report for each one.</p>

    <p>Reporting a discrepancy usually takes up to 10 minutes. The service will time out if you do not use it for 30 minutes and you cannot save your answers.
