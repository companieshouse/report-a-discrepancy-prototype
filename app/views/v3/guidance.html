    <p class="govuk-body">This is any entity required to carry out due diligence checks under anti-money laundering regulations.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">Obliged entities include:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>credit institutions</li>
      <li>financial institutions</li>
      <li>auditors, external accountants or tax advisors</li>
      <li>notaries or other independent legal professionals</li>
      <li>trusts or company service providers</li>
      <li>estate agents, including when acting as intermediaries</li>
      <li>other persons trading goods in cash amounting to €10,000 or more</li>
      <li>gambling services</li>
      <li>exchange services between virtual and fiat currencies</li>
      <li>custodian wallet providers</li>
      <li>art dealers in galleries and auction houses</li>
      <li>art dealers in free ports</li>
      <li>insolvency practitioners</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="govuk-body">Obliged entities must tell us if there’s a difference between the information on the Companies House register, and the information they hold about a:
    </p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>PSC of a company</li>
      <li>PSC of a limited liability partnership (LLP)</li>
      <li>PSC of an eligible Scottish partnership</li>
       <li>registrable beneficial owner of an overseas entity</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="govuk-inset-text">
      If you’re not an obliged entity, do not use this service to report a PSC or registrable beneficial owner discrepancy. If you want to update your PSC details, you can

    </div>


    <h3 id="what-a-beneficial-owner-is" class="govuk-heading-m govuk-!-font-size-27">What a person with significant control (PSC) is</h3>
    <p class="govuk-body">A <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/people-with-significant-control-pscs" target="_blank" class="govuk-link">person with significant control (PSC)</a> 
      is someone who owns or controls a company. 
      A company can have one or more PSCs, or none. Any reference to companies in this guidance also refers to LLPs and eligible Scottish partnerships.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">A beneficial owner is not the same as a PSC. The requirement to report 
      discrepancies is based on the Companies Act definition of a PSC, rather than the Money 
      Laundering Regulations’ definition of a beneficial owner. This means that the information on the Companies House register 
      might be different to other beneficial ownership information, but it might not be inaccurate.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body call-to-action">For more information, see <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-to-the-people-with-significant-control-requirements-for-companies-and-limited-liability-partnerships" target="_blank" class="govuk-link">PSC requirements for companies, LLPs and Scottish qualifying partnerships.</a></p>

<h3 id="what-a-bo-is" class="govuk-heading-m govuk-!-font-size-27">What a registrable beneficial owner of an overseas entity is</h3>
    <p class="govuk-body">A registrable beneficial owner is any individual or entity that has significant influence or control over an overseas entity. It can be:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>an individual person</li>
  <li>another legal entity, such as a company</li>
  <li>a government or public authority</li>
  <li>a trustee of a trust</li>
  <li>a member of a firm that is not a legal person under its governing law</li>
</ul>



    <h3 id="what-a-discrepancy-is" class="govuk-heading-m govuk-!-font-size-27">What a material discrepancy is</h3>
    <p class="govuk-body">This is when the information an obliged entity holds is significantly different to the information recorded by Companies House about a PSC of a company, or a registrable beneficial owner of an overseas entity.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">This could include:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>a difference in name</li>
      <li>an incorrect entry for nature of control</li>
      <li>an incorrect entry for date of birth</li>
      <li>an incorrect entry for nationality</li>
      <li>an incorrect entry for correspondence address</li>
      <li>a missing entry for a person of significant control or a registrable beneficial owner</li>
      <li>an incorrect entry for the date the individual became a registrable person</li>

   
    </ul>


    <h3 id="why-report-a-discrepancy" class="govuk-heading-m govuk-!-font-size-27">Why you need to report a discrepancy</h3>
    <p class="govuk-body">On 10 January 2020, the Fifth Anti-Money Laundering Directive (5MLD) came 
      into force in the UK through the Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing (Amendment) 
      Regulations 2019.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">If obliged entities find a discrepancy, they must make a report to Companies 
      House.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">This will help us to make sure that the register is accurate and up to date.</p>
    

    <h3 id="what-is-not-a-discrepancy" class="govuk-heading-m govuk-!-font-size-27">What is not a discrepancy</h3>
    <p class="govuk-body">You do not need to report the following:</p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>if you’ve already made a discrepancy report, you do not need to report the same discrepancy again</li>
      <li>if the discrepancy is resolved in the time between identifying it and submitting a report, you do 
        not need to report it</li>
      <li>it is not a discrepancy when the entity holds information that we do not include on the register</li>
      <li>a spelling error is not a discrepancy, for example, Jon Smith instead of John Smith, or a missing 
        or slightly different spelling of a middle name</li>
      <li>minor variations in an address is not a discrepancy, or where a nationality of Welsh, English, 
        Scottish or Northern Irish is given but the register shows UK</li>
      <li>a PSC or beneficial owner of an overseas entity must own more than 25% of shares to be registrable, so you do not need to report them missing if they own 25% or less (this does not impact people who are PSCs because they control the 
        company in another way)</li>
      <li>where a company has claimed an exemption from providing their PSC details because they are 
        trading on a regulated market, PSC details will not be shown on the register so you do not need 
        to report a discrepancy</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="govuk-body">Obliged entities can advise the company to contact us to correct minor errors.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body govuk-!-font-weight-bold">If a beneficial owner’s correspondence address is 
      different from the service address on the register</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">The address shown for a PSC or beneficial owner of an overseas entity on Companies House records is a service address - 
      this does not have to be their home address. Obliged entities should take this into consideration.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">PSCs and beneficial owners of an overseas entity must provide their home address to Companies House, but it’s kept on a 
      private register. It’s only available on request to credit reference agencies and specified public 
      authorities.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">As their home address is not available on the public register, it might not 
      be a discrepancy if it does not match the address given to an obliged entity. If the address a 
      client has provided is different to what is shown on the register, you may wish to check with 
      them if they have used an alternative to their home address as a service address.</p>
    
    <p class="govuk-body">You should only make a report when there is a clear discrepancy between the 
      same types of address.</p>


    <h3 id="when-to-make-a-discrepancy-report" class="govuk-heading-m govuk-!-font-size-27">When to make a discrepancy report</h3>

    <p class="govuk-body">Obliged entities must make a report if they find a discrepancy when setting up 
      a new business relationship with a customer.</p>
    
    <p class="govuk-body">You should report a discrepancy as soon as possible. Bulk reporting is not 
      allowed, so obliged entities must not wait to make reports in bulk as this means the register 
      will not be up to date.</p>


    

    <h3 id="start" class="govuk-heading-m govuk-!-font-size-27">Make a discrepancy report</h3>
    <p class="govuk-body">To report a discrepancy, you'll need:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
       <li>to tell us what the discrepancy you are reporting relates to</li>
      <li>the company number or Overseas Entity ID of the company or entity being reported as having a discrepancy</li>
      <li>the type of discrepancy</li>
      <li>the information on the  register you believe is incorrect, for example an incorrect address or an error in the nature of control</li>
      <li>the correct information as you believe it should be shown on the register</li>
      <li>any other relevant information about the discrepancy that supports the report</li>
    </ul>
 <p class="govuk-body">From 1 April 2023, you can only use this service to report a discrepancy if it:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>relates to money laundering</li>
        <li>relates to terrorist financing</li>
        <li>appears to conceal details of the business of the customer</li>
   </ul>
   <p class="govuk-body">If the discrepancy relates to money laundering or terrorist financing, you must also report this to any organisations you are obliged to report to.</p>
 

    <p>Reporting a discrepancy takes up to 10 minutes. The service will time out after 30 minutes and your answers will not be saved.

    <p class="govuk-body">We’ll check our records and if we find that the reported discrepancy needs to be corrected, we may contact the company and ask that they resolve it to make sure the register is up to date. If the discrepancy is not resolved
      by the company or overseas entity, we may remove the incorrect information from the register.</p>
